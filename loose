so, i have changed the project card as a clickable link using anchor tag with some params in it, for which are going to accomplish later in this video. i have also added a 'view-more' button at the end of the projects area, which navigates us to a new route called works. in this route, i have rendered some text embedded in-between the nav-bar and texture with the footer at the bottom. besides, we have this view-more button again in our works page which is needed. we can't remove it from the projects component, because, it has to be there for the home page. so, we are going to 'conditional-render' it which appears only in home route and not in the works route. for doing this, i am going to use pathname parameter from the window dot location query. okay, now, we got the pathname and let's define the condition on the a tag using this. it is going to render only it the pathname is 'slash works'. fine, we got it. now, let's add the unique routes for the each projects by using the U-R-L params from react-router. got to app dot JS and create a new route with a URL parameter at the end of the path. i have created a component called 'Single' which is going to render a single component in it. now, inside the Single component, i am going to display the params using the U-R-L params from react-router-dom. now, let's check it. yeah, we got it. we are now able to render different data in a component based on the U-R-L params. okay, let's design the single project page in the next session. So, see you on the next video!
